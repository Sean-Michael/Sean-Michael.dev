            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>
                I work on infrastructure, and backend systems. 
                I'm passionate about automation as a driver for teamwork, and enabling people to get their work done and have fun doing it.
                
                Lately I've been interested in AI.

            <h2>Outside Work</h2>
            <p>
                I love sitting and building things, playing with new technologies, and reading books on the O'Reilly platform, but when I need a break I like to be active.
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rock Climbing - outdoors preferabbly!</li>
                    <li>Cycling - cruising around town, long gravel rides, or MTB at Galbraith!</li>
                    <li>Skiing - I live for this come winter time</li>
                    <li>Strength Training - I bench 225 btw</li>
                    <li>Yoga - So FUN! Lots of ways to enjoy, hot flow, yin</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes though, I do things that don't involve work or learning new technologies and aren't outdoor sports. :)
                I've enjoyed taking the time to hone creative and artistic skills which give me an awesome outlet for exploring myself and the world.

                <ul>
                    <li>Guitar - My favorite and longest praticed, I love to play while my fiance sings</li>
                    <li>Photography - As a teen I enjoyed digital photography but have since taken a keen interest in the 34mm film variety</li>
                    <li>Drawing - My fiance has been teaching me to draw and I've really enjoyed practicing and trying to improve this skill</li>
                </ul>
