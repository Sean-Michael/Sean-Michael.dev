I wanted to learn Kubernetes and hadn't really been using the Gaming PC for much lately, so I figured it was homelab time.

## The Hardware

- RTX 2070Super 8GB
- 64GB RAM

## Installation

Getting k3s running was surprisingly easy:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
```

## What I Learned

Running a home lab teaches you things that reading docs never will...
