                        The summer preamble to my academic career at Oregon State University was a life changing experience.
                        I had the amazing opportunity to travel to London to study abroad in one of the most storied cities of the western world.
                        Going to this place fulfilled a childhood dream of mine. I grew up fascinated by British history, specifically the events of the Second World War.
                        I can recall many a night sat in front of the TV watching any and every BBC program that OPB was playing with my family.
                        I loved the accents, the atmosphere, and mostly just the <em> idea </em> of London.

                        This blog is a work in progress, as is this post.
                        I will add more to this post when I get a chance.
                        I'm hoping to figure out some way to automate my formatting so that I don't have to type these into Visual Studio.
